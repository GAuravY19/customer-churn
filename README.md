# Insurance Premium Calculator

## Introduction

The Insurance Premium Calculator is a machine learning-based solution developed to accurately estimate insurance premiums for customers. This project, aims to streamline the process of premium calculation by leveraging ML algorithms to evaluate multiple factors that influence insurance costs. By incorporating a diverse range of customer data, such as age, health metrics and claim history, our model provides precise and fair premium estimates.
